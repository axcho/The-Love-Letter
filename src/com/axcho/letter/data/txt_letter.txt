WARNING!!! This letter is top secret!

You must read it ALONE
before the 2ND PERIOD BELL!

Okay...

To my secret love:

Hi! You don't know me, but
I've had the BIGGEST CRUSH on you
all the way since 3rd grade!

I guess since you are
the most popular boy in school
you probably have 100 girlfriends.
But if not, keep reading...

I think your wavy black hair makes
you look handsome and mysterious.

I have black hair, too.
Do you like girls with black hair?

You probably don't remember,
but one time you lent me your pencil
and when I was done you said
I could keep it.
I still have it!

Okay, I know you must think
I am the BIGGEST IDIOT
for writing you this letter,
but if you don't, keep reading...

Meet me in front of my locker
right after the bell.
If you are there,
I will know that you like me!
If you are not there,
my heart will be broken
but I will understand!

Love,
Your Secret Admirer

P.S. Oops! I almost forgot to tell you...

My locker number is #112.
