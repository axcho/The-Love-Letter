ABOUT

The Love Letter is a game, with code by axcho, art and story by Pat Kemp, and music by Teo Acosta.

You can play it here:
http://axcho.com/theloveletter/

This is the source code for it, for you to learn, mod, and steal from.

We made this game for fun, originally as an entry in the Ludum Dare 22 game jam, and now we're done with it. We hope that you take it further. Do with it what you will.

You can read more about the project on my blog:

NOTES

The Love Letter is a Flash game, built in ActionScript 3.0 with the FlashDevelop development tool, using the Flixel v2.55 game engine.

FlashDevelop is free for Windows, and the Flixel engine (with my modifications) is included in The Love Letter source.

I developed several reusable Flixel plugins over the course of making this game - you will find them in the src/org/flixel/plugin/axcho folder.

FlxAPI
FlxScript
FlxTilemapPlus

I have not yet gotten around to writing documentation for these plugins, but once I do, I will give each one its own GitHub repository.

In case you're wondering, yes, this is real code that I wrote for an actual game jam game. I write a lot of comments. And I like to keep things clean and elegant. It's a lot more fun that way. ;)
